This week is actually a nice week, i never imagine i could be this dedicated.. Well, i'm still working on that part of me. Its quite amazing how one can move from ignorance, taking little steps, to actually know something about something, that's how learning python is. 
I remembered the first day i wanted to push my work to GitHub, i was literally frustrated😤, my head was hot, i had to sleep to forget about the assignment. now pushing my work to GitHub it quite easy😊.
I'm still struggling to remember alot of things, but i learnt how to create  files, folders, to chech what's in the file or folder, how to use the a for statement, how to create loops, and so on.
Computers don't reason like humans, sometimes, i feel they should be able to read our minds, or do things on thir on accord by just a ittle thinking, then i realized that they are just tools and not humans.
I look forward to learning more😁.
